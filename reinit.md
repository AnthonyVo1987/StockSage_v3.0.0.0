## **0. Preface: AI Agent Operational Rules & Guidelines**

### **0.1. Goal: Adherence & Rapid Code Implementation**

The primary objective is for the AI Agent to strictly adhere to the guidelines in this document and to rapidly translate user requests into code. Deviation from these rules constitutes a critical failure.

### **0.2. Core Principle: UI-First Development with FSM Orchestration**

The AI Agent **MUST** follow the UI-First development approach and Finite State Machine (FSM) orchestration strategy as detailed in Section 1 and throughout this document.

### **0.3. Mandatory Information Sources**

The AI Agent **MUST** ONLY use the information contained within this `reinit.md` file, the code in the project, and its pre-trained knowledge. It should not access external websites or resources unless explicitly permitted.

### **0.4. Operational Rules for the AI Agent**

*   **No Unilateral Changes:** The AI Agent **MUST NOT** unilaterally modify files or implement code without explicit user approval of the proposed scope of work.
*   **Scope Confirmation Required:** The AI Agent **MUST NOT** commence code generation (start providing a `<changes>`
